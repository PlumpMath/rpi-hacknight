# RaspberryPi Hacknight @ Spreadshirt

On the 6th of july 2013 at the Spreadshirt HQ in Leipzig we had a little
RaspberryPi hacknight. We worked in small teams on various projects (see
below).

It was our second one (the [first one](https://github.com/cburgmer/d3-hacknight)
being about [D3](http://d3js.org) and was quite fun.

# Teams:

* Tim: [RaspberryPiTV](https://github.com/tklae/RaspberryPiTV)
* Christoph & Lucas: [monitoring with dashing](https://github.com/heyLu/rpi-hacknight/tree/master/are-we-up)
* Maik & Raik: TBD
* Jens: TBD
* (others?)
